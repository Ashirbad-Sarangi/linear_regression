			       Linear Regression


Linear Regression is a method which is extensively used in the field of machine learning in training a model to generate a linear equation using the attributes and coefficients based on the data fed to model. This model is supervised by the outputs of the data. Linear Regression basically regresses i.e. goes from the outputs to find weights and then produces the values through which the coefficients are found. The output of the model is checked through the performance measures like MSE, RMSE etc. methods where the predictions are compared with the actual output and the results. The performance measures show to which degree is the model dependable and what is the margin of error for the performance. In lay man terms, linear regression is a method through which a linear equation is built from the data with the attributes as variables.Due to the large amount of data present, the weights or the co-efficients of the variables are found out.

				 Specifications
In this repo, there is a class of linear of regression built from scratch. The library used are :
[-] pandas : to read the dataframes
[-] numpy : to perform the matrix calculations
[-] matplotlib : to plot the graphs

				  Description
The generalised class of the linear regression has certain variables and functions to make the work easier.
